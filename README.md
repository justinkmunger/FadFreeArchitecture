# Fad-Free Architecture Presentation and Weather App

The Weather app requires Xcode 8 Beta 2 and uses Swift 3.

An OpenWeather API key is required for the application. A free API key can be obtained at http://openweathermap.org/appid

After obtaining an OpenWeather API key, open APIKey.plist and replace `<Add your API key here>` with the actual key.
